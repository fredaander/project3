main class  - Encoder.java
	-array with probabilities
	
	for single symbol and 2 symbol
	
	helper method read in file
		read in list of non-negative integers - one number per line
		let A be first number, B be second and so on
	helper method computer entropy
		use array with probabilities
	helper method Huffman Algorithm
		use entropy and Huffman Algorithm to devise binary encoding
		Print encoding to the screen in nice format
	helper method RandomText
		generate random text from our alphabet at the expected probabilities
		store text in a file name testText
	helper method EncodeText
		encode testText
		Create file named testText.enc1
	helper method DecodeText
		decode testText.enc1
		Create file named testText.dec1
	
	
	measure the efficiency by computing the actual average bits per 
	symbol as you do the translation. compare this with the computed
	entropy of the language and record the percentage difference.
	
	Extra Credit
	Character Frequencies in a file
		-Use same code to read in file as before?
		-use tolower on string
		-create an array of 26
		-break string down
		-check if character is a letter
		-array [i] stores count
	
	
	
	OVERALL OUTPUT
	
	Std Out
		encoding for single symbol
		encoding for 2 symbol
		results on the screen
			average bits per symbol on the screen?
